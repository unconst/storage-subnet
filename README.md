# Running the template
Before running the template you will need to attain a subnetwork on either Bittensor's main network, test network, or your own staging network. To create subnetworks on each of these subnets follow the instructions in files below:
- `docs/running_on_staging.md`
- `docs/running_on_testnet.md`
- `docs/running_on_mainnet.md`

    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode

# To run the validator
python -m neurons/validator.py 
    --netuid <your netuid> # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --subtensor.chain_endpoint <your chain url> # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --wallet.name <your validator wallet>  # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
