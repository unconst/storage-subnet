This is a prototype incentive mechanism for storage where miners serve their harddrive space onto the network and prove its existence to validators. Miners are rewarded proportionally to the amount of space they can prove they have, and also allow encrypted data to be stored there by validators. The amount of space available to each validator is proportional to the amount of stake they have on the network.

# Partitioning

To partition your available space fun the following command.
```bash
python partition.py 
    --netuid <the subnet netuid> # This is the netuid of the storage subnet you are serving on.
    --threshold <threshold i.e. 0.0001>  # The threshold for the partitioning algorithm which is the maximum amount of space the miner can use based on available.
    --path <path to partition>  # This is where the partition will be created storing network data.
```

# Installation
This repository requires python3.8 or higher. To install, simply clone this repository and install the requirements.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor-subnet-template.git

Once you have installed this repo and attained your subnet via the instructions in the nested docs (staging, testing, or main) you can run the miner and validator with the following commands.
```bash
# To run the miner
python -m neurons/miner.py 
    --netuid <your netuid>  # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --subtensor.chain_endpoint <your chain url>  # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --wallet.name <your miner wallet> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode

# To run the validator
python -m neurons/validator.py 
    --netuid <your netuid> # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --subtensor.chain_endpoint <your chain url> # Must be attained by following the instructions in the docs/running_on_*.md files
    --wallet.name <your validator wallet>  # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --wallet.hotkey <your validator hotkey> # Must be created using the bittensor-cli
    --logging.debug # Run in debug mode, alternatively --logging.trace for trace mode
```
